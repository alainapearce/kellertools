\usage{

}
\arguments{
\item{pwlb_data}{a data.frame all items for the Parent Weight-Loss Behavior Questionnaire following the naming conventions described above}
}
\value{

\description{
This function scores the Parent Weight-Loss Behavior Questionnaire and provides subscale scores for the following behaviors: Healthy Weight Control and Unhelathy Weight Control.
}
\details{
To use this function, the data must be prepared according to the following criteria:
1) The data must include all individual questionnaire items
2) The  columns/variables must match the following naming convention: 'pwlb#' where # is the question number (1-29; only 1-24 are needed to compute scale as 25-29 are contextual questions)
3) Questions 1-24 must have the numeric value for the choices: 1 - Never, 2 - Rarely, 3 - Sometimes, 4 - Often, 5 - Always. Questions 25-29 are scored differently and are follow-up questions.

Note, as long as variable names match those listed, the dataset can include other variables
