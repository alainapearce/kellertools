\title{util_fbs_child_v5dat: Process raw qualtrics visit 5 data for the child}
\usage{
util_fbs_child_v5dat(file_pattern, data_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_pattern}{string with the pattern to search for to find the raw data file. The pattern must contain respondent and visit number (e.g., for files from parent visit 1, would enter 'Parent_V1').}

\item{data_path}{(optional) the full path to the directory where the raw Qualtrics database are saved, EXCLUDING the .sav file name (e.g., '.../b-childfoodlab_Shared/Active_Studies/RO1_Brain_Mechanisms_IRB_5357/Participant_Data/untouchedRaw/Qualtrics_Raw/'). If NOT entered, will assume the database is saved in the working directory.}
}
\value{
A list containing: 1) data: data.frame with raw, cleaned data from child visit 5 Qualtrics; 2) dict: all variable descriptions;; 3) pna_data: data.frame marking participants who 'prefered not to answer' (pna) specific questions; and 4) pna_dict: all variable descriptions for pna_data
}
\description{
This function loads the .sav raw data file for the child visit 5 data that was collected via Qualtrics and cleans the data. Cleaning the data involves:
1) extracting all variable descriptions,
2) selecting relevant data columns,
3) removing all practice events (e.g., 999)
4) re-ordering and re-name data columns
5) reformatting dates to be appropriate and computer readable: YYYY-MM-DD
6) re-calculate manual variables
7) fix 99's / create prefer not to answer database
8) random fixes to factor level names and variable descriptions
}
\details{
The databases MUST follow the naming convention: Child_V5_YYYY-MM-DD.sav
}
\examples{
#if in same working directory as data:
child_v5_dat <- util_fbs_child_v5dat('Child_V5')

\dontrun{
#file_pattern must be a string. The following will not run:
child_v5_dat <- util_fbs_child_v5dat(Child_V5)

#file_pattern must have the respondent ('Child') and visit number ('V5'). If just enter 'Child', the script will not run because it will return multiple files for different parent visits. The following will not run:
child_v5_dat <- util_fbs_child_v5dat('Child')
}
