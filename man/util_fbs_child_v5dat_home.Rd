\title{util_fbs_child_v5dat_home: Process raw qualtrics visit 5 home data for the child}
\usage{
util_fbs_child_v5dat_home(date_str, data_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{date_str}{the date used in the name of the .sav file (e.g., for file 'Parent_V1_2021-10-11.sav', the string '2021-10-11' would be entered)}

\item{data_path}{(optional) the full path to the directory where the raw Qualtrics database are saved, EXCLUDING the .sav file name (e.g., '.../b-childfoodlab_Shared/Active_Studies/RO1_Brain_Mechanisms_IRB_5357/Participant_Data/untouchedRaw/Qualtrics_Raw/'). If NOT entered, will assume the database is saved in the working directory.}
}
\value{
A list containing: 1) data: data.frame with raw, cleaned data from child visit 5 Qualtrics collected in the home and 2) dict: all variable descriptions
}
\description{
This function loads the .sav raw data file for the child visit 4 data that was via Qualtrics at the child's home when the procedure was split due to covid and cleans the data. Cleaning the data involves:
1) extracting all variable descriptions,
2) selecting relevant data columns,
3) removing all practice events (e.g., 999)
4) re-ordering and re-name data columns
5) reformatting dates to be appropriate and computer readable: YYYY-MM-DD
6) re-calculate manual variables
7) fix 99's / create prefer not to answer database
8) random fixes to factor level names and variable descriptions
}
\details{
The databases MUST follow the naming convention: Child_V5_Home_YYYY-MM-DD.sav
}

#if in same working directory as data:
ch_v5_dat_home <- util_fbs_child_v5dat_home('2021-10-11')

#date must match the file name - for file named 'Child_V5_Home_2021_09_16', the
